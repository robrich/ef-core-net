Entity Framework Core on .NET 5
===============================

This is the companion code to the [Entity Framework Core](https://robrich.org/slides/ef-core-net/) presentation.

When we look to data in .NET, we land on Entity Framework – the .NET ORM built by Microsoft. But what is Entity Framework? What other tools exist in the ecosystem? How do we optimize data processing in Entity Framework? What’s new in EF Core 5? Let’s dive into Microsoft’s ORM and see how we can effectively process data in .NET.

Usage
-----

1. Use the files in the `sql` folder to construct the database.
2. Adjust the connection string in `appsettings.json`.
3. Run the app, debugging through each entry.

Note: some of the examples intentionally fail until the code is adjusted as part of the presentation. Notes are below the method.
